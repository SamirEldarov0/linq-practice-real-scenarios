LINQ Practice – Real World Scenarios

This repository contains 100+ LINQ queries written in C# based on real-world business scenarios.
It is designed to demonstrate practical usage of LINQ for data processing tasks commonly used in .NET backend development.

The examples focus on writing clean, readable, and efficient LINQ queries for filtering, grouping, aggregation, ranking, and transforming in-memory collections, similar to patterns used in production applications.

Topics Covered

Filtering and projections (Where, Select)

Grouping and aggregations (GroupBy, Count, Average, Min, Max)

Sorting and ranking (OrderBy, OrderByDescending, indexing)

Flattening collections (SelectMany)

Distinct data handling (Distinct, DistinctBy)

Date-based queries

Anonymous types and data transformations

Business-oriented scenarios (users, salaries, countries, activity status)

Tech Stack

Language: C#

Framework: .NET

Concepts: LINQ (Method Syntax)

Structure 

All LINQ examples are implemented in a single console application and clearly separated by numbered variables and comments for readability and learning purposes.

Purpose

This project serves as:

Hands-on LINQ practice

A reference for common backend data-processing patterns

Supporting evidence of practical C# and LINQ experience
